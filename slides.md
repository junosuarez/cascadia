# TypeScript: The Good Parts

// my name is Jason, jden on the internet. I'm a healthcare hacker and a javascript engineer at Agile Diagnosis, where we help doctors practice better medicine. Since this is a developer audience, you'll appreciate what I mean when I say our product is like an IDE for doctors.

// In a sense, what I want to talk about today is helping developers practice better software. Developer productivity is very important to me, because I have a confession to make. I think there are things in life more important than writing software.

"Solving problems for those in the world with the least problems" [[1]](http://venturevillage.eu/grandma-tech-hype#)

// Lots of people are writing a lot of software these days - and rustling up quite a bit of money to do it. But I agree with Peter Thiel when he says that innovation overall has stagnated- in terms of its impact on society.

// I want people to work on shit that matters, and part of that means making it easier for more developers to write more code faster. And not just any code - but high-level, domain-specific code that tackles real problems.

## HypeScript?
- hundreds of languages targetting JS
- fragmentation?
- code reuse

// So why am I so sanguine about TypeScript? We're seeing a proliferation of compile-to-JS languages. altjs.org lists over 130 languages which compile to JS, like CoffeeScript, Roy, Dart, and others.

// They all offer something to someone. We should embrace language innovation targetting JavaScript. Eich has been calling JavaScript the Bytecode of the web. This is great. This gives us a wide variety of interoperable languages that can share modules in the same execution space with the exact same primitive types.

// So just like you can use Java modules from other JVM languages, like Scala, we can use CoffeeScript modules from plain old JavaScript.

// TypeScript is no different.

## But... it's Microsoft
- embrace
- extend
- extinguish?

// additionally, I had a gut reaction of "OSS washing" surrounding the launch of TypeScript. Certainly compared to some of Microsoft's other OSS efforts, notably by the Azure team, the open sourcing of TypeScript felt a little tone-deaf. But the licensing checks out - the spec is freely licensed, and the compiler and services (implemented in TypeScript) are Apache 2 licensed.
